# Security Fixes and Mitigations

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified during the audit and the mitigation strategies implemented.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. âœ… Service Worker Interference (Critical)
**Issue**: Service worker was intercepting Vite development server requests, causing module loading failures.
**Fix**: 
- Created development-friendly service worker that doesn't intercept requests in development
- Only caches static assets in production
- Prevents interference with HMR and module loading

### 2. âœ… XLSX Security Vulnerabilities (High Priority)
**Issues**: 
- Prototype pollution vulnerability (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6)
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Created secure XLSX wrapper (`src/utils/secureXLSX.js`)
- Implemented input validation and sanitization
- Added file size limits (10MB max)
- Disabled dangerous XLSX features (formulas, HTML parsing)
- Prevented prototype pollution with secure object creation
- Added ReDoS protection with string length limits

## Remaining Vulnerabilities (Monitored)

### 1. ðŸ”¶ DOMPurify in jspdf (Moderate)
**Issue**: XSS vulnerability in DOMPurify version used by jspdf
**Status**: Requires breaking change to jspdf@3.0.1
**Mitigation**: 
- Using our own DOMPurify import for securePrint utility
- jspdf usage is isolated and controlled
- Consider upgrading jspdf in future releases

### 2. ðŸ”¶ esbuild in Vite (Moderate) 
**Issue**: Development server request vulnerability
**Status**: Requires breaking change to Vite@7.0.0
**Mitigation**:
- Only affects development environment
- Production builds are not affected
- Consider upgrading Vite in future releases

### 3. ðŸ”¶ undici in Firebase (Moderate)
**Issue**: Insufficiently random values and DoS vulnerabilities
**Status**: Dependency of Firebase SDK
**Mitigation**:
- Firebase team will address in future releases
- Vulnerability is in HTTP client layer
- Production Firebase hosting provides additional security

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Input Validation
- File type validation for uploads
- File size limits
- String length limits to prevent ReDoS
- Sanitization of user inputs

### XSS Prevention
- DOMPurify for HTML sanitization
- Secure print utilities
- No use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- Formula injection prevention in Excel exports

### Access Control
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Admin role verification
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Secure environment variable usage

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging
- Production monitoring
- Graceful degradation for security failures

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. âœ… Use secureXLSX wrapper for all Excel operations
2. âœ… Monitor service worker performance in production
3. âœ… Regular security audits with `npm audit`

### Future Considerations
1. **Upgrade Dependencies**: Plan breaking changes for major security updates
2. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers for additional XSS protection
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints
4. **Security Headers**: Ensure all security headers are configured in hosting

## Testing Security Fixes

### Service Worker
- Test in both development and production
- Verify no module loading errors
- Check caching behavior in production

### XLSX Security
- Test file upload validation
- Verify formula injection prevention
- Test with various file sizes and formats

### General Security
- Run regular penetration testing
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies updated

## Emergency Response

If security vulnerabilities are discovered:
1. Assess impact and severity
2. Apply immediate mitigations
3. Update this documentation
4. Notify team and users if necessary
5. Plan permanent fixes
