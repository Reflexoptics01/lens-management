# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Lens Management System

## ðŸš€ Enhanced PDF Printing Workflow

The printing system has been completely redesigned for maximum efficiency. Here's how the new streamlined workflow works:

### âš¡ Quick Print Options

After saving an invoice, you get these efficient printing options:

1. **Quick Print (Recommended)** 
   - Press `P` key or click "Quick Print (P)" 
   - âœ… Auto-closes all modals after printing
   - âœ… Pre-fills PDF filename with customer name + invoice number
   - âœ… Auto-closes print window after saving
   - Example filename: `John_Optical_Invoice_61.pdf`

2. **Direct Download**
   - Press `D` key or click "Download (D)" button
   - âœ… Immediately triggers print dialog with smart filename
   - âœ… Auto-closes modal after download starts
   - âœ… No new tabs to manage
